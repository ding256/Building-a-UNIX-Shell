# shell-project
Designing a shell that functions like the standard shell

The first part of this project focuses on creating an allocator that can coalesce and free data chunks, dealing with memory fragmentation issues that are essential in operating system programming. The OS data structures were studied and mimicked.

The second part is creating a full-functioning shell that can do user-interaction commands such as pipe, file redirection, signal handling, parsing, subshell, ctrl-c, escape, tilde expansion, wildcarding, path-completion, history, line-editing.

Tools studied and utilized are isatty(), lex, yacc, bison, zombie elimination, environment variable, the readline model, memory fragmentation and allocation, linked list.
