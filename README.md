# Building a UNIX Shell
Designed a feature-rich shell with user-interaction functionalities, including pipe, file redirect, signal, subshell, hotkey, escape, wildcard, path complete, history, line editing, zombie elimination.

Successfully implemented memory fragmentation management in shell, achieving efficient memory allocation by coalescing chunks, utilizing a free-list to store memory chunks, and optimizing memory allocation, enhancing overall performance and resource utilization.

The first part of this project focuses on creating an allocator that can coalesce and free data chunks, dealing with memory fragmentation issues that are essential in operating system programming. The OS data structures were studied and mimicked.

The second part is creating a full-functioning shell that can do user-interaction commands such as pipe, file redirection, signal handling, parsing, subshell, ctrl-c, escape, tilde expansion, wildcarding, path-completion, history, line-editing.
